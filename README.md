# Kmean Clustering
      To find clusters in the Iris dataset which contains four features (length and width of sepals and petals) of 50 samples of each  three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica, and Iris versicolor).
First, the elbow method is used to find the optimum number of clusters.


The K-Means Clustering Model (Unsupervised Machine Learning Algorithm) is deployed onto the data set and each data entry is assigned a cluster
